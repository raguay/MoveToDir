## MoveToDir

Plugin for [fman.io](https://fman.io) to move a selection of files to a directory. If the directory doesn't exist, create it and move the files.

Install by uploading "MoveToDir" to your [data directory](https://fman.io/docs/customizing-fman)`/Plugins`.

### Usage

Select one or more files/directories and press **Shift+m** (I'm using my Vim Keymappings). Fman will then ask for a directory name. If the directory doesn't exist, create it and move the files there. Otherwise, just move the files.

**Warning**: Currently it runs in the same process/thread so be aware that running properties on a large dir will cause the UI to hang while calculating size

### Features

 - Creates named directory if it doesn't exist
 - Moves the files to that directory
